# ImpactFactorsAndPvalues
Unbiased scientific reporting is crucial for data and research synthesis. This R code corresponds to the manuscript "High impact journals in ecology cover proportionally more statistically significant findings" available from bioRxiv at https://doi.org/10.1101/311068. In this study we extract p-values from all articles published in 11 journals in ecology and conservation in 2012 and 2014 across a wide range of impact factors with six journals sampled in both years. Our results indicate that the proportion of statistically significant results increases with rising impact factor. The data is available at: https://figshare.com/projects/High_impact_journals_cover_proportionally_more_statistically_significant_findings/28284.
